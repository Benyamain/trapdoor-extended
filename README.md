# Gotta Catch 'Em All: Using Honeypots to Catch Adversarial Attacks on Neural Networks
### ABOUT

This repository contains code implementation of the paper "[Gotta Catchâ€™Em All: Using Honeypots to Catch Adversarial Attacks on Neural Networks](https://www.shawnshan.com/files/publication/trapdoor.pdf)", at *ACM CCS 2020*. The slides are [here](https://www.shawnshan.com/files/publication/trapdoor-ccs-clean.pdf). 
Trapdoor is a defense against adversarial attack developed by researchers at [SANDLab](https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/), University of Chicago.  

### Note
The code base currently only support MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset and two different attacks, CW and PGD. 

### DEPENDENCIES

Our code is implemented and tested on Keras with TensorFlow backend. Following packages are used by our code.

- `keras==2.3.1`
- `numpy==1.16.4`
- `tensorflow==1.14.0`

Our code is tested on `Python 3.6.8`


### How to train a trapdoored model

There is a pretrained CIFAR trapdoored model in ./model and the trapdoors injected are in ./results

If you would like to train a new model or change the setup: 

`python3 inject_trapdoor.py --dataset mnist`

`python3 inject_trapdoor.py --dataset cifar`




### How to run attack and detection: 

Given a trapdoored model in ./model and pattern stored in ./results. Run: 

`python3 eval_detection.py --dataset mnist --attack pgd`

`python3 eval_detection.py --dataset cifar --attack pgd`

Make sure to change the MODEL_PATH, RES_PATH when running the code on customized models. 

The code will run targeted PGD attack on 3 randomly selected label. It will print out the AUC of detection and the attack success rate at 5% FPR. 

To randomize the neuron matching process as we discussed in Section 7.2:

`python3 eval_detection.py --dataset mnist --filter-ratio 0.1`
